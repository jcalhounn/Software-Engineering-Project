/**
 * API 3: Conceptual API within the compute engine process
 * 
 * Lots of options for this! 
 * Right now, because it's a conceptual boundary, we don't have to worry
 * about things like wire compatibility, so the return type can be more concrete (depending on
 * exactly what you're computing, yours might be a long, Set<Integer>, byte[], etc)
 * 
 * However, there's no harm in adding a wrapper around the result (ex: SingleComputationResult);
 * you'll notice that by leaving it concrete, we're relying on the fact that this API is within
 * a single process, and therefore can have Exceptions propagate across it. There are tradeoffs here - 
 * on the one hand, using a simple type simplifies both the use and implementation of the interface;
 * on the other hand, by building the 'in the same process' behavior into the design, we'll have to
 * change the return value if this component ever moves to a different process or server (foreshadowing...).
 * 
 * For the input, there's also nothing wrong with using a wrapper around the int, but since we're given
 * from the system specification that it will always be an int, it's fine to just use that as well.
