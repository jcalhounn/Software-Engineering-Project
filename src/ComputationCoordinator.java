/**
 * API 1: A network API between the user and the compute engine
 * 
 * This design uses a single request wrapper to handle the various pieces of information the user
 * needs to provide. 
 * 
 * Other options include specifying all pieces as parameters (likely using method
 * overloading to handle the default delimiter), or building up a 'ComputationJobSpec' by having the
 * user provide each piece with a separate method (this is similar to the Builder pattern we talked about
 * for immutable objects).
